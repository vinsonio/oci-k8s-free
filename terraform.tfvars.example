# You MUST have a way to access the private API endpoint to use kubectl:
#   Option 1: OCI Bastion Service (below) - free, easiest for getting started
#   Option 2: Site-to-Site VPN (below) - free, secure, requires on-prem VPN equipment
#   Option 3: Temporarily set kubernetes_api_public_enabled = true

# ℹ️  NOTE: Worker nodes are in PRIVATE subnets (secure default)
# You'll see a warning in OCI Console about setting up a bastion host.
